# Project: Dental Clinic Analysis

## Project Overview
In the city of N-sk (with a population of around 4,000 people), a new dental clinic has opened.

### Concept Description
1. **Quarter 1**: The clinic hired 2 doctors. During this time, the clinic used an active marketing strategy, offering services at or slightly below the average market price.
2. **Quarter 2**: A promotion was introduced, giving a discount on the first visit. Service prices remained the same, but since the market prices dropped, the clinicâ€™s prices became slightly above average. This helped attract new clients, allowing the clinic to hire a third doctor in Quarter 3.
3. **Quarter 3**: The initial discount was replaced with a referral program, offering discounts for each new client referred by an existing customer. Service prices were lowered, but the market prices dropped even further.
4. **Quarter 4**: The clinic decided to hire a fourth doctor and remove all discount programs.

### Financial Status
Currently, the clinic is struggling financially. Although it has shown a small profit in recent months, the overall financial balance is negative.

### Task
data analyst to study the business reports, create calculations, and propose a strategy for Quarter 5 to maximize profitability.
